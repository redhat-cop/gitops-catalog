# rhods-operator

Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) is a machine-learning-as-a-service
platform built on Red Hat's Kubernetes-based OpenShift Container Platform,
Ceph Object Storage, and integrating a collection of open source projects.

The RHODS operator allows users to install and manage RHODS components.
Users can mix and match tools from each project to fulfill the needs of
their use case. Each of the projects share some components, but can be
mostly seen as an extension of each other to provide as complete a solution
as possible for enterprise users.

### Components

* Notebook Controller - Open source multi-user notebook platform w/ GPU support
* RHODS Dashboard - Dashboard for Red Hat OpenShift Data Science
