Kubernetes provides access to special hardware resources such as NVIDIA GPUs, NICs, Infiniband adapters and other devices through the [device plugin framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/). However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors.
The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introducing-the-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.
Visit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information. For getting started with using the GPU Operator with OpenShift, see the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/openshift/contents.html).
