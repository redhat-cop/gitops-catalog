# Compliance Operator

## Which Channel to Use?

The channel naming is particularly confusing for this operator.  To determine which version to use, please check the docs for the OpenShift release you are using (make sure you change the version in the drop down):
* [OpenShift Compliance Operator Docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-installation.html)

Currently, the supported channel for OCP 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 is `release-0.1`.   The `4.7` channel is not included, as it is legacy.  More channels will be added as they become available.

Channels:
* [release-0.1](release-0.1)
