# NFS CSI Driver

This deploys the [NFS CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs) for Kubernetes, which allows Kubernetes to access NFS servers on Linux nodes. This driver supports dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes via Persistent Volume Claims by creating new subdirectories under an NFS server.
