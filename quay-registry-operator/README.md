# OpenShift Quay Operator

Installs the OpenShift Quay Registry operator.

Do not use the `base` directory directly, as you will need to patch the `channel` based on the version of OpenShift you are using, or the version of the operator you want to use.

The current *overlays* available are for the following channels:
* [stable-3.6](overlays/stable-3.6)
