# GitOps Catalog

[![Build Status](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/workflows/Lint/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/actions?workflow=Lint)

The GitOps Catalog includes kustomize bases and overlays for a number of OpenShift operators and applications.

This catalog is not officially supported by Red Hat and customers are discouraged from referencing this repo directly as a remote repo in kustomize as future changes may break these references. Instead customers are encouraged to take individual items of interest into their own curated catalog and maintain it as their own.

See [Operator Info](operator_info.txt) for a detailed list of dumped OpenShift operator info.

## Catalog Refactoring for Consistency

Now that this catalog is part of the Red Hat Community of Practice, there will be some structural refactoring to improve consistency.  If you have been using this catalog since before it was part of the `redhat-cop` organization, or at least before any refactoring has begun, be sure to include a `ref` in your `oc/kubectl` commands or `kustomization.yaml` files to avoid any negative side effects.  The last tag before the repository was migrated is `v0.3`.  Simply include `?ref=v0.3` at the end of the repository reference.  

For example:

```
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/jenkins2/overlays/default?ref=v0.3
```

Or

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
- github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/jenkins2/base/?ref=v0.3
```

## Usage

Each catalog item has (or will have) its own README in its directory root with instructions.  Generally speaking, you can usually just apply a "base" or "overlay" directly in your cluster by cloning this repository and using the `-k` flag (for Kustomize) built into `oc` and `kubectl`:

```
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog
oc apply -k catalog/jenkins2/overlays/default
```

Or to skip the cloning step:

```
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/jenkins2/overlays/default
```

## Kustomize

You can reference bases for the various tools here in your own kustomize overlay without explicitly cloning this repo, for example:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: product-catalog-cicd

resources:
- github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/jenkins2/bases/?ref=main
```

This enables you to patch these resources for your specific environments. Note that none of these bases specify a namespace, in your kustomization
overlay you can include the specific namespace you want to install the tool into.

## Development

You can use the following to help you create the basic structure for an operator.

```
# load functions
source scripts/automate_operators.sh
```
